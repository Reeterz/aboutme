                    <p class="bolder">Born in the lively streets of Sta. Cruz, Manila, I now find myself residing in the tranquil embrace of Mindanao, within the nurturing walls of my grandparents' home. From the urban hustle to the rural calm, my journey reflects the contrast of two worlds. Despite the distance, the values instilled in me amidst the bustling city remain steadfast resilience, perseverance, and a deep appreciation for simplicity.</p>

                    <p class="bolder">Here in Mindanao, amidst the verdant landscapes and the gentle rhythm of rural life, I find solace and connection. Surrounded by the love and wisdom of my grandparents, I am reminded of the importance of family, heritage, and the enduring spirit of home. In this convergence of past and present, I continue to cherish the richness of my Manila roots while embracing the serenity of my newfound haven in Mindanao.</p>
